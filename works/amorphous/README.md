Amorphous Butterfly is a speculation on machine-mediated relationships and the potential for intimacy with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Exploring ideas of 'Artificial Intimacy' and what it means to have a connection and find meaning.Two bright, abstract entities give visual form to a charRNN language model. They morph and animate as they generate text, future deities conversing with each other. 

This was adapted into a net piece where the ‘seed text’ can be modified and the (dis)connections made in this speculative relationship can probe the audience as to whether they can be touched by this encounter. In a gallery space, the two entities would inhabit a corporeal form of two computer monitors. The physical interaction of poseNet would be more effective in a gallery setting as the audience will be moving around as opposed to sitting in front of a browser.
